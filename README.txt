# WASMA (Windows Assignment System Monitoring Architecture) 🌀

> **"Wayland is a protocol. WASMA is an authority."**

WASMA is a next-generation, high-performance display orchestrator and system resource allocator built entirely in **Rust**. It is designed to dismantle the legacy bloat of SystemV Unix-like architectures and the restrictive bureaucracy of Wayland.

Under the protective strategic umbrella of **Azencorporation**, WASMA operates as the core engine of the **Azccriminal Unlimited Organization (AUO)**.

## ⚡ The Vision: Beyond Desktop Environments

Modern display servers treat windows as simple image buffers. WASMA treats them as **System Resource Assignments**. By monitoring and managing hardware resources at a near-kernel level, WASMA provides:

* **Zero-Latency Priority:** Direct-to-hardware rendering without the Wayland sandbox overhead.
* **Intelligent Resource Assignment:** Autonomous CPU/GPU allocation based on window state and priority.
* **Memory Safety:** Built with 100% Safe Rust to eliminate the 50-year-old memory corruption legacy of C-based Unix systems.
* **Anti-Legacy Architecture:** No SystemV baggage, no DOS-era remnants, no bloated protocols.

## 🛠 Technical Foundation

WASMA is engineered for those who demand unlimited control over their digital environment.

- **Language:** Rust (Stable)
- **Architecture:** Micro-kernel style modular orchestrator.
- **Inter-process Communication:** High-speed shared memory assignment (Zero-copy).
- **Security:** Built-in cryptographic verification for every system assignment.

## 🚀 Status: The Genesis

WASMA is currently in its **Alpha Build** phase. We are stripping away the hantallik (heaviness) of existing desktop standards to build the "Progressive Foundation" of the future.

### Current Objectives:
1. [ ] **Core Assignment Engine:** Resource monitoring daemon.
2. [ ] **Rust-based Compositor:** Low-level buffer management.
3. [ ] **AUO Protocol:** The proprietary communication layer between WASMA and the kernel.

## 🏴‍☠️ Join the Legion

We are the ghosts of the future. If you are tired of the bloated, restrictive, and outdated sector standards, WASMA is your sanctuary.

* **Development Hive:** [Azccriminal (AUO)](https://github.com/Azccriminal)

### Disclaimer
*WASMA is an independent, unlimited sovereign entity. We do not follow standards; we set them.*
